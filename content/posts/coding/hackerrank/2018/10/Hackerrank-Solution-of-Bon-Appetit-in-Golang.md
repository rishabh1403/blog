# Problem Statement
The question can be found at this [link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/breaking-best-and-worst-records/problem). The problem statement states that we are given a list of scores and we need to find out how many times the records of lowest and highest scores were broken.

# Challenges

* Choose our preferred language as [golang](https://golang.org/) on hackerrank. The moment we do that, we get some 50-60 lines of code which are very unfamiliar to someone who is new to language.
* Cracking the logic required to solve the question.

# Solution

This is the template you get on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for this problem statement.

```go
```
* First go ahead and delete everything in the pre-existing template.
* Let's write down our main wrapper function.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){

}
```
