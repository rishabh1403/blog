It's been a week since I started writing and upoading youtube videos. Just taking a minute to thank everyone for their support.

# Some stats
Hey everyone, thank you so much for your support on my YouTube Channel as well as on blog over here. In the past week, I got 250+ views on YouTube and 100+ page views on my blog. All thanks to you guys, your support, constructive criticism, and honest feedback. It kept me motivated to upload a post and video every day, and I plan to keep doing that as long as I can.

I'll be lying if I say I wasn't afraid about the response I would get, or the criticism I would face, but now I feel more confident and have full faith that I can carry on with the plans I have in mind for the blog as well as my channel.

Once again thank you for all your support and feedback, and I look forward to seeing you around in the next one :)
